# INTP | Logician -  Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Perceiving

## How to engage with INTP
We don't bother with small talk. We just don't. </br>
But a conversation about science, mathematics, computers, quantum physics rabbit hole, spritiual reality, mystics of the universe is a great alignment. </br>
Reality is often of only passing interest to the Architect, as we are more interested in the theory behind it all. </br>

## Mysteries of the Universe
As the title suggest, this personality type want to understand everything in the universe, but one area in particular tends to mystify them: human nature. </br>

## Trait
Great observance </br>
Disregard authority </br>
Being misunderstood and don't mind about it </br>
Lies detector </br>
Small circle </br>
Respect differences </br>
Meditation </br>
Needs alone time - a lot </br>

## Circle
Normally we disconnect with low frequency and dont even bother to connect to social norm. </br>
As great observance we study you more and more until we're ready to let you in.  </br>
If you can patiently wait, you'll earn yourself a loyal human. We share information at anytime, 
only if you are interested that is. </br>

## Truth seeker
INTPs can detect lies very quickly. The energy does not lie. We adopt the ability to sense human energy quickly. Just be honest. We no judge </br>
We all seem to fuel our minds with as much knowledge as possible. We abandoned hookers, food, Materialism and fashion to buy books, visit museums and attend lectures. We find pleasure in developing and improving our inner world and internal systems. 

## INTP Anger
I’d say that an INTP is much scarier when angry than any other types. If you think an INTP isn’t scary when angry, then you haven’t seen an angry INTP.
From my experience as an INTP, I don’t tend to show when I’m angry with expressions. </br>
I tend to remain completely neutral and expressionless. </br>
I have great tolerance. But if you get me to my breaking point, you will regret it. </br>

You might have heard about INTP door slam. </br>
Basically, you become non existent. People who hurt us or create negativity & stress are cut out of our lives. </br>
We do have emotional inteligent but we do not feel the need of connect to that particular frequnecy.
You can try to talk to me and all I give you is silence. </br>
That's how INTPs are in their demon mode. It takes deliberate analysis, it takes time to arrive to that decision and if we do that, 
that means we previously cared very deeply about you but you disappointed us big time. </br>
To get to that point where you no longer exist, whether as an enemy or a friend or even a stranger, you gotta do something really fatal.
INTPs normally don’t get too emotional, but when you make them angry, they will get "angry". </br>

## What if you pass INTP inner circle entrance test
Welcoming you into their unique world full of mysteries and ideas.

## The truth about vibration
1st - Thoughts </br>
Every thought emits a frequency out to the universe and that frequency goes back to the source, so in case if you have negative thoughts, discouragement, sadness, anger, fear, it all comes back to you. This is why it is so important that you take care of the quality of your thoughts and learn to cultivate more positive thoughts.

2nd - The Companies </br>
The people around you have a direct impact on your vibrational frequency. If you surround yourself with happy, positive, and determined people, you will also enter this vibration. Now if you surround yourself with complainers, medics and pessimists, be careful! Indeed, they can decrease your frequency and therefore prevent you from exploiting the law of attraction in your favor.
 
3rd - The Music </br>
Music is very powerful. If you only listen to music that talks about death, betrayal, sadness, abandonment, all of these will interfere with your vibration. Pay attention to the lyrics of the music you listen to, it could be lowering your vibrational frequency. And remember: you attract exactly what you vibrate into your life.

4th - Things You Watch </br>
When you watch shows that deal with misfortune, death, betrayal, etc. your brain accepts this as reality and releases a whole chemistry in your body, which affects your vibrational frequency. Watch things that do you good and helps you vibrate at a higher frequency.

5th - The Mood </br>
Whether at home or at work, if you spend a lot of time in a disorganized and dirty environment, it will also affect your vibrational frequency. Improve your surroundings, organize and clean up your environment. Show the universe that you are capable of receiving so much more. Take care of what you already have!

6th - The Word </br>
If you pretend or speak poorly about things and people it affects your vibrational frequency. To maintain your frequency high, it is essential to eliminate the habit of complaining and bad talking about others. So avoid the drama and victimization. Take responsibility for your life choices!

7th - The Gratitude </br>
Gratitude destroy negativty. Practice gratitude daily. Gratitude has a positive effect on your vibrational frequency. This is a habit you should incorporate into your life now. Start giving thanks for everything, for the good things and what you consider bad, give thanks for all the experiences you have experienced. Gratitude opens the door for good things to happen positively in your life
