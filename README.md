# INTP | Logician -  Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Prospecting

## How to engage with INTP
We don't bother with small talk. We just don't. </br>
But a conversation about science, mathematics, computers, quantum physics rabbit hole, spritiual reality, mystics of the universe is a great alignment. </br>
Reality is often of only passing interest to the Architect, as we are more interested in the theory behind it all. </br>

## Mysteries of the Universe
As the title suggest, this personality type want to understand everything in the universe, but one area in particular tends to mystify them: human nature. </br>

## Trait
Great observance </br>
Disregard authority </br>
Being misunderstood and don't mind about it </br>
Lies detector </br>
Small circle </br>
Respect differences </br>
Meditation </br>
Needs alone time - a lot </br>

## Circle
Normally we disconnect with low frequency and dont even bother to connect to social norm. </br>
As great observance we study you more and more until we're ready to let you in.  </br>
If you can patiently wait, you'll earn yourself a loyal human. We share information at anytime, 
only if you are interested that is. </br>
INTPs can detect lies very quickly. The energy does not lie. We adopt the ability to sense human energy quickly. Just be honest. </br>

## INTP Anger
I’d say that an INTP is much scarier when angry than any other types. If you think an INTP isn’t scary when angry, then you haven’t seen an angry INTP.
From my experience as an INTP, I don’t tend to show when I’m angry with expressions. </br>
I tend to remain completely neutral and expressionless. </br>
I have great tolerance. But if you get me to my breaking point, you will regret it. </br>

You might have heard about INTP door slam. </br>
Basically, you become non existent. You can try to talk to me and all I give you is silence. </br>
That's how INTPs are in their demon mode. For us, it takes deliberate analysis, it takes time to arrive to that decision and if we do that, 
that means we previously cared very deeply about you but you disappointed us big time. </br>
To get to that point where you no longer exist, whether as an enemy or a friend or even a stranger, you gotta do something really fatal.
INTPs normally don’t get too emotional, but when you make them angry, they will get "angry". </br>
